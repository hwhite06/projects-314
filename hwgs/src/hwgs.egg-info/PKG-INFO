# Holly White- Genome Seqeuncer 
This project will accept samples of DNA as text files and return 
RNA strings as well as the amino acid chain that is produced from 
the RNA chain. The DNA sample will undergo a series of functions for conversion. 

##Error Check 
The DNA sample will first be checked for invalid nucleotide values. 
In other words it will ensure that all values are either a, c, t, or g. 

##Trancription 
The DNA sample will then be turned into an RNA string by converting 
all t values, or thymine nucleotines to u (uracil). 

##Translation 
The RNA string will then be converted to an amino acid chain by 
reading the codons within the RNA string. 

##Other functions 
Comparisons between two amino acid chains can also be performed. This will 
indicate the similar amino acids between two chains, which may help indicate their 
function in an organism.
